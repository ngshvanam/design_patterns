Encapsulate what varies.

Program to interfaces, Not implementations.
Strive for loosly coupled design between objects that interact.

Dependet on Abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
Only talk to your friends.
Don't call us we will call you.
A class should have only one reason to change.
